# CRUD-C

This is a simple CRUD system written in C. It has basic capabilities like creating a database and adding, updating and removing elements from the database. All data is stored in a .txt file.

This CRUD system has a "game store theme" and was made as final project for our C programming classes at [UENP](https://uenp.edu.br/).
